    White was Tony R (traded early), Steve G, Paul G, Sheila, Gui, Sui, Knudsen, Todd, Dane, Joe (traded), Jamie (traded), and Barry in goal 
    
    Dark was Tim V, Stan, Shawnski (traded early), Karissa, Weddie, Aaron C, Todd, Grant, Shalanah, Kiemo (traded), Foss (traded), and Moore in goal 

    White got the first four before Dark began its comeback. The first was flukey. Tim V got the ball behind his own net. His attempted breakout pass accidentally hit Sheila in the thigh and bounced right into the Dark goal past Moore. 1-0 White. 

    White's second goal was much more spectacular. Knudsen got the ball and flipped it into the top shelf from a hard angle. Someone commented that he made a 'flip like Gill.' It was that nice. 2-0 White. For some reason, the Tony's got traded about this time. Tony R went White and Shawnski went Dark. 

    White came down again. Knudsen came down on the right side and took a shot. Moore made the original save, but gave up a rebound to the top of the circle. Foss (still playing on the White team) picked it up and slid a pass back over to Knudsen. This time Knudsen put the ball past Moore. 3-0 White. 

    White continued to outplay Dark. Foss was still on the White team and got the ball behind the goal line. He passed out to Dane. Dane hit the ball out of the air. It hit the top left crossbar and went over the net. Foss picked it up again and looked to Dane again. Dane started crossing in front of the goal with the defender right on him. Foss mirrored him. Dane stopped and went the other way. Foss switched directions as well and passed out to Dane again. Dane scored this time. 4-0 White. About this time, Kiemo and Foss got traded to the Dark team while Joe and Jamie got traded to the White team. 

    Dark started getting some shots, but Barry was tough early on. Shalanah eventually sent a breakout pass up the boards to Stan. Barry came running WAY out thinking he could get to it, but Stan won the footrace and chipped the ball over Barry's broom. The ball kept going until it found the net. Dark is starting to back. It's 4-1 White. 

    Dark got another. Shalanah shot one past Barry, assisted by Kiemo and Grant. 4-2 White. 

    Kiemo got the next one, assisted by Foss. Now it's 4-3 White. 

    White was afraid they were about to give up a 4-0 lead if Dark would tie it up. But they kept playing strong. Knudsen brought the ball down into the Dark zone. He dropped the ball to Tony R, who was back near the point. Tony floated a high, hard, arching shot that found its way into the upper left corner of the net past Moore. 5-3 White. 

    Next, Dark turned the ball over in the neutral zone. Dane picked it up and raced in, placing the ball into the top right corner past Moore, unassisted. 6-3 White. 

    Dark got the ball deep in the White zone. White could not break it out. White would made a pass or two, but failed to make that third pass that would clear the zone. Now Shawnski got the ball down low to Grant in the left corner. Grant came out from the corner and went around Dane. As Barry moved out from the net, Grant executed a perfect hand move, tapping the ball right between Barry's legs and into the net. 6-4 White. 

    White came back. Tony R got the next one, assisted by Knudsen and Todd. 7-4 White. 

    Foss, Kiemo and Stan got a 3-on-1 vs. Steve G. Foss passed up to Kiemo. Kiemo brought the ball in (barely onside). Kiemo brought it toward the net. Steve conceded the lane to Stan. Kiemo passed to Foss. Foss shot a wrister. Steve, who was screening the goalie, got a little piece of it, but not enough. Foss scored! Stan, who had crashed the net and was right at the doorstep never touched the ball. 7-5 White. 

    Shawnski got the next one for Dark. 7-6 White. Could Dark come back and win? 

    No! Knudsen passed over to Joe, who fired one in, making it 8-6 White. It would remain 8-6 for the final. Someone noticed that there was a variety of scorers tonight and no one on Dark had multiple goals. Here are some quotes that were overheard in the lock_infoer room: 

    1. Weddie made lots of good passes but couldn't score.
    2. Why was Dark so overmatched at the beginning of the game?
    3. Gui was successful in not scoring.
    4. Aaron C made an impressive save on Knudsen.
    5. Paul G made a great pick and had lots of stellar plays.
